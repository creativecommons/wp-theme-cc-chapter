Creative Commons Chapter site theme (including chapter sites setup,
taxonomies, and widget code)

== Installation ==

This theme uses npm, gulp, and browserify to manage dependencies.

Versions of node and npm we know work:

- npm 3.3.12
- node 5.4.1

To install gulp:

- run npm install -g gulp

To build the js/css:

- run npm install to download the 3rd party libs in package.json
- during development:
  - run "gulp" in the background, i.e. run gulp in a terminal and leave it
    running. It will automatically recompile `css/app.css` files as you edit
    the src files.
- when preparing for production:
  - run "gulp dist" to create minified "css/app.css" files.
- also update the CC_CSS_RELEASE_SERIAL_NUMBER at the top of functions.php to
  purge the caches.
